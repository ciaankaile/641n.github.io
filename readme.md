 A form is an educational stage, class, or grouping of pupils in a school. Pupils are usually grouped in forms according to age and will remain with the same group for a number of years, or sometimes their entire school career. School is intended to prepare students for life. But what do we mean by that? On the one hand, we mean that it provides students with the necessary skills to gain a career after graduation and become productive members of society
